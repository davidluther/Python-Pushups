# Python-Pushups
A collection of solutions to coding challenges of the type found on HackerRank or in *Cracking the Coding Interview*, in the ongoing effort of sharpening the Python chops. I try to present at least a couple different solutions for each one — e.g. iterative v. recursive, using built-ins or roll-your-own — and often time them to see how each performs as input scales.

Many of these are works in progress, and may well change from time to time.

As the purpose of these exercises is educational, I welcome any feedback or discussion!
